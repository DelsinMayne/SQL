# In this project, I analyzed a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store, and answered various questions listed below.


# Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country, CustomerID
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";


# Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";


# Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerID
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";


# Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, EmployeeID, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";


# Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


# Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT inv.InvoiceID, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, emp.EmployeeID

# Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

# Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
